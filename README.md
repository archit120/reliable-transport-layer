# Network Simulator <span style="font-size: 12px">_(tentatively)_</span>

They say you learn best by doing. This project is an attempt at replicating the OSI stack at least upto network layer. The protocols implemented are not necessarily exactly the same as their real world counterparts because the goal is to just create a simplified structure. Everything has been written from scratch in the time-frame of a single quarter course.

Currently Implemented -
 - Mock network layer with support for loss, corruption and reordering
 - Functional GBN half-duplex client

WIP - 
 - Selective Repeat half-duplex
 - Network Layer with support for multiple hosts
 - Full duplex communication
 - More?
